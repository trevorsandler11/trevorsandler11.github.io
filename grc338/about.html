    <p>Lamb Jam began as the passion project of three college friends—Santino Pryor, Trevor Sandler, and Kai Lehr—who wanted to bring people together through great food, authentic culture, and real music. What started as a backyard gathering quickly grew into a vibrant Argentine-style cookout open to anyone and everyone. Rooted in tradition, Lamb Jam celebrates the art of slow-cooked meats, shared tables, and community—values inspired by Argentina’s famous asados, where friends and strangers alike come together to enjoy incredible flavors and unforgettable moments..</p>
    <p>The live-music side of Lamb Jam was born just as organically. Trevor and Kai—members of the local college/community band RAMP—imagined a space where musicians from any background could plug in, play, and jam with no rules, no set genre, and no expectations. That spirit shaped the Lamb Jam experience: good vibes, good sound, good people. Alongside the music, we began serving our own house-made nitro yerba mate on tap, another nod to Argentine culture and a favorite among our guests.</p>
    <p>As our community grew, so did our team and our menu. What once featured only lamb now includes tri-tip, chorizos, skirt steak, and a rotating mix of crowd favorites—ensuring there’s something for everyone who arrives hungry. Looking forward, our goal is to transform Lamb Jam into a full festival that celebrates food, music, and culture from around the world. We’re here to create spaces where people connect, discover, and enjoy—and we’re just getting started.</p>
